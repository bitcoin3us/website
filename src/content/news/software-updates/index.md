- Additional boot slogans.
- Only the first character of weekdays will be displayed.

**What’s new with V2.0.0**

Extended battery life:

- Infinite wifi retry, infinite HTTP response waiting time and other long battery-draining exceptions are addressed with a "smart" watchdog.
- The wake-up frequency now adapts based on a seven-point profile correlated with battery voltage.

User experience improvements:

- Realtime balance and payment updates also happen under battery power after manual wake-ups, thanks to new awake/sleep status decision logic.
- Notification code enhancements that help the user to easily troubleshoot any possible errors.
- On-screen indication when the device is sleeping vs awake.
- New on-screen software update visibility.
- New startup screen logo by Bitko.

Optional new features:

- Fiat balance and Bitcoin price with configurable fiat currency (USD, EUR, DKK,...)
- Random boot-up 'quotes and memes' with configurable prelude.
- Show last updated day and time.

Removed features:

- Disabled HAL sensor value as it wasn't useful.
