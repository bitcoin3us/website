While fiat savers are wallowing in the mud, LightingPiggy keeps on shipping!

Check out our latest v6.2.0 update, it’s a meal of new user experience improvements.

For starters, the device now displays the exact day and time it last checked your wallet; updated every minute in "no_sleep" mode.

Talking of “no_sleep” mode, for main course, you can now choose the vibe that suits your power source:

- "no_sleep" – always awake (great for mains, solar, and big batteries)

- "custom_sleep" – default 6-hour snooze (perfect for batteries, solar and custom set-ups)

- "endless_sleep" – deep hibernation with shake-to-wake (perfect for small batteries!)

Here’s the full change log:

**User Experience (UX) Improvements**

- Detailed startup feedback: The device now shows real-time status updates during startup (e.g. connecting to Wi-Fi, syncing time, launching webserver, fetching wallet data).

- Always-on clock display: The current time is now continuously shown while the device is powered on, not just before going to sleep.

- Localized weekday names: Weekday names are once again translated into your local language.

- Configurable sleep modes *(Feature Request #35) detailed above.*

- Last wallet check timestamp: The device now shows the date and time it last checked your wallet (updates every minute in no_sleep mode).

**Fixes & System Enhancements**

- Switched to standard NTP: All time synchronization now uses pool.ntp.org, removing the dependency on timeapi.io.

- Automatic Wi-Fi reconnection: The device will now attempt to reconnect automatically if Wi-Fi is lost.

- Periodic auto-restart: The device now performs a daily (every 23 hours) restart to proactively avoid potential issues.

- Cross-platform build support: The same firmware build now runs seamlessly on both physical and virtual (QEMU) ESP32 devices—no recompilation needed.

You can install it using the **Web Installer**, which has now hit a milestone—**no known open issues**!

If you’re already on version **5.x or later**, your existing configuration will be preserved during the upgrade.

Enjoy the update! Stay humble, hog sats!
